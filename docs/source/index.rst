   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Docsnt
==================================

Docsnt (pronounce as "doc sent") is just a combination of "doc" and my name,
`snowme34 <https://www.snowme34.com>`_.

This is a personal web page using `Readthedocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_
and `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ documenting something fun (I think)
to share.

Please refer to the table of contents below and in the sidebar for your topic
of interest. You can also use the search function in the top left corner.

Also this site supports https, open "https://docs.snowme34.com" if you address bar
shows an http.

.. note:: This is a personal wiki-like place. There is no guarantee about anything.
          Please `contact me`_ if you spot any errors. You can also create an issue
          on the `repo`_.
